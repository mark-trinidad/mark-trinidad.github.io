<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning to Walk</strong> is an interactive project where you can train an AI bot to walk and improve its skills using reinforcement learning. The AI bot learns from its environment, adapting and getting smarter over time as it faces new challenges.</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: The bot uses trial and error to enhance its walking abilities.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Adaptation</strong>: Watch as the bot continuously improves based on its experiences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Training Environments:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Even Terrain</strong>: A flat surface to begin training.</li>
  <li><strong>Uneven Terrain</strong>: An unpredictable environment that adds complexity.</li>
  <li><strong>Inclined Terrain</strong>: A sloped surface to test the botâ€™s balance and navigation skills.</li>
</ul>
