        <p>
        Hello! I'm Mark from Philippines, and I grew up on the humble island of Bahrain. From a young age, Iâ€™ve been 
        fascinated by how computers work. I remember experimenting with VMware and Linux to explore 
        ethical hacking, which sparked my passion for technology and led me to pursue software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some of the technologies I've been working with:</p>
        <ul className='skills-list'>
          <li>ReactJS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beyond my work in software development, I'm deeply interested in advancements in Artificial Intelligence. 
          In my free time, I enjoy playing games with friends and staying up-to-date with tech innovations.
